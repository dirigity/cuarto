                                Why is Africa so Poor<br>
                            </Titulo>

                                Everyone knows that africa is poor, but most people don’t understand why. When you think about africa you do not imagine <hilight class="correct">high flying</hilight> jobs and people dressed up elegantly, you imagine hunger, wars, epidemics. In reality there are really rich people in africa, but their are a really small minority. They are the owners of the crop fields that feed the world, but the normal people, the ones that are affected the most, are forced to work in those crop fields under miserable conditions and really low salaries. Clearly a realy <hilight class="correct">extresing</hilight> job, because you need to try to not get fired at any time because the albitraryty of the owners. This may have been the heavier factor of them all, but definetily it is not the only one. 
                                <br>In the areas where people live far away from big businesses like plantations, they earn for a living by being farmers in farms that produce just enough for them and their families. In theory this should be a normal life, but the problem is that people fight against each other to steal their animals. This happens because population grows and the animal polulation does not keep up. When people try to defend their plantations and properties they often get hurted and unabled to do their jobs. This produces that a big part of the population can’t help anymore to the social economy and drags it to poverty. 
                                <br>Furthermore, europe is not helping at all. Africa is the richest country in the world when it comes to raw materials such as gold or coltan, but the other countries buy it under its real price so they can get even richer. This international <hilight class="correct">boicot</hilight> doesn’t help at all, it sinks their economy to a deep pit of poverty.

                                Most people are not aware of all the difficulties that refugees have to go through to reach countries with Spain. So we contacted a Syrian refugee who is residing in Valencia and is part of an awareness campaign to accept more refugees.
                                <div>
                                    <br><Strong>When did you decided to leave your country?</Strong>
                                    <br>It was a very delicate situation. It wasn’t in my home waiting to a bomb exploding, I was in the front line. I stopped doing the military service and abandoned Syria because I either killed or killed me. It is a civil war, Syrians against Syrians. It was not my place.
                                    <br><Strong>Was it from one day to the next?</Strong>
                                    <br>The tension was lived for many years, already with the coup d'etat of Al Asad. In 2010 the checkpoints started, too much police in the street ... And I exploded. We <hilight class="correct">were thrown at a deep end</hilight> and I was the only one that arrived alive. In 2011 I came. I had not thought of it, just either escape or finish with a bullet in my head 
                                    <br><Strong>Where is residing your family?</Strong>
                                    <br>My mother and maternal family had been living outside for years. My uncle came to work and study, he left the country during the armed conflict of 1983. My grandparents came to visit him, but because of my grandfather's illness they stayed here. My father is still in Syria because he and his family is involved in politics. There I also have an 11 year old sister and a stepbrother.
                                    <br><Strong>How did your father's family feel about your escape?</Strong>
                                    <br>Pretty bad. For them, I deserted, and they had problems with the secret police and the military police. We have also clashed a lot about political issues: we think differently. They are with the government and I am not against only the regime, but against everything that is happening. Right now you can not be neutral, or you are from one side or from another. And everyone has their hands stained.
                                </div>
                                <br>As we, see refugees like Sami Shihadeh are trying to escape from this horrible situation and we are not giving them the opportunity of living as normal citizens. But Syrian refugees like him could even be more prepared than us to do, for example, politics, because they already know which things will lead to a bad political situation.

                                in 2015 a contract was signed between turkey and the EU in order to fix the situation of the african refugees. Right now Turkey is the main entrance path way for refugees to get to Europe. This means that Turkey <hilight class="correct">has a lot in the plate</hilight>, because the people that get to their frontiers are homeless and in most cases they have no money at all. 
                                <br>Turkey government needs help to administer this difficult situation. In this contract EU offers economical help to end this problem with the only condition of it being spend on the humanitarian crisis. Everyone wishes that this cooperation lasts a long time, because it may be the solution to the biggest problem that the world is facing right now. 
                                <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5860_en.htm">You can find the complete document here</a> 

                                <br>This is not the first document of its kind. There have been other documents where a group of different countries accorded how many people were they going to let in, but most of them have disappeared in a big and useless bureaucracy. Hopefully this document isn't a one of a kind event and gets repeated more in the future. 
                                <br>The last document of this kind was signed in 2015, and since then there have been no more guvernamental projects to try to fix this situation. This is the reason why we encourage people to <hilight class="correct">get the ball rolling</hilight> and sign this petition in change.org. The petition asks the EU to react to the situation this people are living

                               The vast majority of citizens think that when a refugee comes to live to the UE and gets here successfully all their problems are over and they can start a new decent life. But the reality is very different to what we think, there are cases of journalists that have been sent to the refugee camps to get information about their way of living there. Generally the feedback given by them is not positive. 
                               <br>There is a refugee camp in the north of turkey that is known to be the best one in the world but a journalist looking for information to make an article about this topic discovered that the living conditions of the refugees were not the apropiate at all. Even the kids were sleeping in tents at -5 grades celsius with just a thin jacket because that's the only resources that they had available. This journalist asked people about their stay in the camp. She was always told about how boring and <hilight class="correct">repetitive</hilight> their lives had become. But the most shocking thing was that everyone was grateful because in that moment everyone could <hilight class="correct">put their feet up</hilight> and don’t worry about being killed because of the wars or hunger.

                                People that want to leave their country, usually because of wars or because of hunger are not in a good economical situation. So they decide to emigrate to new countries in the worst conditions we can imagine. 
                                <br>The method most used by immigrants from Africa to reach Europe are the boats, small boats that rent in their country of origin and are used by hundreds of immigrants at the same time, this boats are not <hilight class="correct">glamorous</hilight> at all, moreover this boats are not in good conditions to make such difficult journey. Traveling by boat is a <hilight class="correct">high skilled</hilight> task and immigrants often don’t have the necessary knowledge to <hilight class="correct">rise to this challenge</hilight>. For this reason every day new boats are discovered that have sunk and left thousands of deads.
                                <br>A clear example of this situation occurred last month, when a boat that had 400 immigrants sank in the Mediterranean leaving 280 dead, of which 70 were children.
                                <br>So to avoid this situation we should help them before they have to use this radical methods that can lead to their death.

                                We are students from a high school of Spain, and we are really worried about the situation that refugees are suffering nowadays. The <hilight class="correct">bottom line</hilight> of this project is to aware the most people possible about the <hilight class="correct">challenging</hilight> conditions that some people are being forced to go through to ensure a better future. People think that refugees come only because of wars but there are other causes that motivate people to risk their lives to emigrate like for instance african people may want to escape from the epidemics that destroy their countries. But when refugees get to europe they hit a <hilight class="correct">death end</hilight> because our society isn’t ready to admit that much people. The only solution that could be accomplished in a near future is to make the country they belong a safer place. This is the purpose of our campaign. We want to show people that the right way of doing things is to help before they need it, so they don’t have to get to a situation of need.
